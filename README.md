# Maximum Matching

This repository contains a Python implementation of Blossoms algorithm to find maximum matching in *any* undirected graph. We also write down unit tests to test the various functions in the algorithm. Finally, the notebook shows the input outputs for a few test cases for the overall algorithm.
